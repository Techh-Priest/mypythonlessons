         #Leap Year Code Challenge

# A leap year occurs when a year is divisible by 4, except for years divisible by 100, unless they are also divisible by 400.
# This logic ensures the calendar year stays aligned with the Earth's orbit around the sun.
# Here's a breakdown of the logic:
#
# Divisible by 4: If a year is evenly divisible by 4 (with no remainder), it may be a leap year.
#
# Divisible by 100: If the year is also divisible by 100, it's not a leap year, unless...
# Divisible by 400: If the year is divisible by both 100 and 400, it is a leap year.

# print("Welcome To Andre's Leap Year Checker App")
# year = int(input("Which year do you want to check?\n"))
#
# if year % 4 == 0:
#     if year % 100 == 0:

#             print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
