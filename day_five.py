            ### Loops

#Things that have to happen repeatedly many time.
#First type of loop is a For Loop

#for item in list_of_items:
    #Do something to each item in the list

# fruits = ["apple", "mango", "peach"]
# for fruit in fruits: #In a For Loop, you give variable called fruit which will be assigned for each item in the list as long as the list and loop runs
#     print(fruit)
#     print(fruit + "pie")
# print(fruits) # this will print after the For Loop is done.

            ## Code Challenge

# student_heights = input("Enter a list of student heights.\n").split()
# for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
#     student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# print(student_heights)
#
# total_height = 0
# for height in student_heights:
#     total_height += height
# print(total_height)
#
# number_of_students = 0
# for students in student_heights:
#     number_of_students += 1
# print(number_of_students)
#
# average_height = round((total_height / number_of_students), 2)
# print(average_height)


    ## Code Exercise
#
# student_scores = input("Enter a list of scores.\n").split()
# for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
#     student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
# print(student_scores)
#
# highest_score = 0
# for score in student_scores:
#     if score > highest_score:
#         highest_score = score
# print(highest_score)

    ##For Loops & The Range Function

# for number in range(1, 11, 3):
#     print(number)

# total = 0
# for number in range(1, 101):
#     total += number
# print(total)

        #Code Challenge: Adding Evens

# total = 0
# for number in range(2, 101, 2):
#     total += number
# print(total)


        #Fizz Buzz Code Challenge
# number = 0
# for number in range(1, 101):
#     if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
#         print("FizzBuzz")
#     elif number % 3 == 0:
#         print("Fizz")
#     elif number % 5 == 0:
#         print("Buzz")
#     else:
#         print(number)
